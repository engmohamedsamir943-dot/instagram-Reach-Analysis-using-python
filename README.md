This project involves analyzing Instagram post data to uncover insights about user engagement and content performance. The dataset contains metrics such as impressions, likes, comments, shares, saves, profile visits, followers gained, captions, and hashtags.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset includes the following fields:

Impressions: Total views of the post.

From Home: Views coming from the home feed.

From Hashtags: Views driven by hashtags.

From Explore: Views from the Explore page.

From Other: Views from other sources like stories or direct shares.

Saves: Number of times the post was saved.

Comments: Number of comments on the post.

Shares: Number of times the post was shared.

Likes: Number of likes.

Profile Visits: Visits to the profile from the post.

Follows: New followers gained.

Caption: Text content of the post.

Hashtags: Hashtags used in the post.
------------------------------------------------

*Key Questions Addressed*
----------------------------------------------------

Does the number of views affect the number of comments?

Does the number of followers affect the number of likes?

Do profile visits lead to more followers?

Do posts with higher saves also receive more profile visits or follows?

What is the relationship between impressions and likes, comments, and shares?

What is the engagement rate per impression for each post?

Is there a relationship between the number of hashtags used and impressions from hashtags?

Data Preprocessing

Dropped duplicates and cleaned the dataset.

Renamed columns for clarity (e.g., Impressions â†’ view_count).

Added feature engineering columns such as:

Ratios of views from home, hashtags, and explore.

Engagement ratios (like_ratio, comment_ratio, share_ratio, save_ratio).

Hashtag count.

Profile visit rate (%).

Checked for missing values (none found).

Analysis Summary

Views vs Comments: No strong correlation found.

Followers vs Likes: Strong positive correlation.

Profile Visits vs Followers: Positive correlation.

Saves vs Followers & Profile Visits: Strong correlation with followers; moderate with profile visits.

Impressions vs Engagement (Likes, Shares):

Strong correlation between impressions and likes (0.85).

Moderate correlation between impressions and shares (0.65).

No meaningful correlation between impressions and comments.
